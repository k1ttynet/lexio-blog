i switched to [nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org), which is static site hosting by [dimden](https://dimden.dev).

before you ask how i got a custom domain, i had to pay ($1/month, pretty cheap lol) in order to get it

before nekoweb, i was using github pages, which takes an incredibly long time to update, not to mention the code is public (sometimes you don't want that LOL)

anyway, here's a link to nekoweb:
