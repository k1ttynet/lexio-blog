our school had an assembly about this thing called "step it up" which was this fundraiser type thing which included prizes.

except, it wasn't this normal fundraiser, there was this "golden ticket" which contained stuff.

here, let me read it to you.

### three ways to earn prizes


#### number 1

e-mail or contact 10 of your friends/family to let them know about it by tonight

prizes include: super fly monkey, cosmic beat bar, the retractor triple charge

#### number 2

share with 10 contacts and you're entered to **win a $250 amazon gift card**

share with 20 contacts for a chance to **win one of four mini fridges stuffed with cash**

#### number 3

#### get more donations, earn more prizes

##### level 1

**enjoy the day of awesomeness and dj dange party**

##### level 2

collect $150 in donations and add **a spin on the money wheel**

##### level 3

collect $250 in donations and add the **burrito blanket**

##### level 4

collect $350 in donations and add **the elephant earbud** (which is a giant airpod kind of?)

collect $500 in donations and add a **jump into the cash bonanza**

collecting $600 or more would be earning an amazon gift card to shop

$600=$25 gift - $750=$50 gift - $1k=$100 gift - $1.5k=$200 gift - $2k=$300 gift - $2.5k=$400 gift

if you couldn't tell already, it seems kind of suspicious

i mean, bribing kids with prizes for money HAS to be a crime.

i know THEY aren't getting the money, but schools hire this thing to get money for themselves. they are literally hiring someone else to bribe

and, it was clear the prizes were sponsored, like all of the prizes had their own videos, all of which seemed like some youtube ad you'd get.

and the worst part was, the students were EXCITED for this.

i tried talking some sense into the person next to me, and it worked.

so now we are the only two protesting against this.

i brought this paper home to my grandma (shes the only one i live with besides my uncle (who isn't a legal guardian)), and she felt the same way.

i didn't even mention it, she just looked at the paper and knew.

i was happy, but the day of awesomeness actually looks fun...

this just makes me think of the other kids who had their parents say the same.

they probably FLIPPED.

anyway i guess thats the end for now.
